# gap-scan

*`SKILL.md` is the prompt Claude follows; this file is for you.*

## What it does

Surveys one or more repos — code, recent commits, docs, open issues, and
(for a UI app) a visual pass — and hands back a ranked list of gaps, bugs,
and extension ideas. Every item cites its evidence (a `file:line`, a commit
SHA, or an issue number); an item with nothing to point at gets dropped
rather than listed. Read-only: it writes one report file and nothing else.

## When to use

- "What's missing", "find gaps", "what should I work on in this repo",
  "scan for bugs/extensions", "survey this repo".
- Starting cold on a repo you (or someone else) haven't touched in a while
  and want a prioritized starting point instead of reading everything by
  hand.
- Not for picking the next task off an existing board — that's
  [`kanban/next`](../kanban/next/) reading the board this skill's output can
  seed. Not for watching an open PR to merge — that's
  [`pr-watch`](../pr-watch/).

## How to invoke

```
/gap-scan [repo path or owner/repo, ...] [--commits N]
```

No argument surveys the current repo. Model-invocable, so the trigger
phrases above work without the slash command.

## How it works

1. **Sync.** Per repo: `git status --porcelain`; if dirty, skip the pull and
   say so; if clean, `git pull --ff-only` (a diverged history is reported
   the same as dirty, never force-merged). A fork also fetches `upstream`,
   reports how far ahead/behind it is, and pulls upstream's own
   `good first issue`-labeled issues.
2. **Survey.** README and docs (flagging doc/code drift), the last ~20
   commits (default; `--commits` overrides), a `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` grep
   over code, the repo's detected test command (run if it looks cheap,
   otherwise skipped with a reason), and every open issue — so a gap that's
   already tracked is marked as such instead of proposed again.
3. **Optional visual pass.** Only for a web/UI app, using the `run` skill or
   a screenshot capability if this session has one; skipped (with a reason)
   for libraries, CLIs, and backend-only services, or when no such tool is
   available.
4. **Rank and tag.** Every surviving candidate gets a value/effort
   trade-off, an `S`/`L` size tag, and mandatory evidence — no evidence, no
   listing.
5. **Write.** One file, `skilleddocs/gaps/<local-date>.md` — the only write
   this skill makes. Never committed unless asked.
6. **Report.** A short chat summary plus the top items inline; full detail
   in the file.
7. **Gate.** Creating issues, commenting, or touching a board needs an
   explicit yes for that specific action; a vague reply means do nothing.
   Offers `kanban-setup`, `divide`, or `grill-docs` as next steps instead of
   taking them itself.

Reads: `git`, `gh`, the repo's files and test command, optionally the `run`
skill. Writes: `skilleddocs/gaps/<local-date>.md` only.

## Design principles

- **Evidence or it doesn't exist.** A ranked list that can't be traced back
  to a line, a commit, or an issue is just opinion; this skill would rather
  under-report than pad the list.
- **Don't re-litigate the board.** Cross-checking open issues before
  ranking means the output adds to a backlog instead of duplicating it.
- **Report, then stop.** Surveying and proposing is the whole job; turning
  a proposal into an issue or a PR is a separate, explicitly gated step
  (or another skill's, via the hand-offs in §7).

## Use cases

- Picking up a repo cold and wanting a prioritized "start here" instead of
  reading every file yourself.
- Before a planning session, to get a fresh, evidence-backed list to sanity
  check against what's already on the board.
- On a fork, to see both home-grown gaps and upstream's own
  `good first issue` backlog in one pass.
- Periodic health check on a repo you maintain but haven't looked at in a
  while — doc drift and TODOs tend to accumulate quietly.

## Tips

- Run it before `kanban-setup` on a repo with no board yet — its output is
  ready to backfill from.
- An `L`-tagged item is a signal to run `divide` on it before anyone starts,
  not to tackle it in one sitting.
- If the test command looks expensive or needs credentials, the report says
  "not run" and why instead of guessing at the result — check that line
  before trusting a "tests: clean" read of the repo.
- The visual pass only fires for actual UI apps; a "skipped" line for a
  library or CLI is expected, not a missing feature.

## Example

```
/gap-scan
```

Run read-only against a skills-and-agents repo (a collection of small
Markdown-defined Claude Code skills, a lint script, and a small static
site). Sync: clean, pulled nothing new. Survey found:

- No `TODO`/`FIXME` markers in any script or hook — the handful of
  matches were skills' own docs *describing* that convention, not
  unresolved markers, so nothing was listed for those.
- The lint script warns (non-fatal) that 15 skill `README.md` files are
  missing four required sections. That gap already has an open issue
  covering exactly this, so it's listed as **already tracked**, not
  proposed again.
- Two hook scripts that gate destructive or billable commands each ship a
  `--self-test` mode, but CI runs lint, the site build, and the unit-test
  suites only, never those self-tests. A regression in either guard would
  merge green. Cheap to fix, high stakes: the top new item.
- The static site's per-skill detail page is a template that still says
  "coming soon". A real extension, but bigger: it needs a decision on what
  each page shows.

Chat summary:

```
Scanned <repo> (synced clean).
6 candidates -> 3 after evidence + already-tracked filter.
Report: skilleddocs/gaps/2026-09-26.md

1. [S] Run the hooks' --self-test in CI - both guards have one, CI never
   calls it (evidence: .github/workflows/ci.yml:23-31,
   agents/hooks/guard-git.py:120, hooks/spend-guard.py:245)
2. [L] Real per-skill detail pages - template is a placeholder
   (evidence: site/src/detail.html:17)
3. [S] README section backfill - already tracked: #22

Tests: ran (python unittest suite), 9 passed.
Visual pass: skipped (the site is a sub-project; not in scope this pass).
```

No issues were created — that needs an explicit yes per §7 of `SKILL.md`.

## Related

- [`kanban-setup`](../kanban/kanban-setup/) — backfill a board/issues from
  this skill's report, offered but never run automatically.
- [`divide`](../kanban/divide/) — split an `L`-tagged item into
  session-sized issues before work starts on it.
- [`grill-docs`](../grill-docs/) — stress-test a candidate gap before
  committing to it, with a paper trail.
- [`kanban/next`](../kanban/next/) — the read side of an existing board;
  `gap-scan` is for when there's nothing to read yet, or you want a fresh
  pass regardless of what's on it.
- [`pr-watch`](../pr-watch/) — the equivalent read-then-gate loop for open
  PRs instead of a repo's overall state.

## Prereqs

`git`, `gh`. The `run` skill (or an in-session screenshot capability) is
optional and only used for the visual/UX pass on web/UI apps — skipped with
a note when absent.
