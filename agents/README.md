# agents/ — subagents

*Each `<name>.md` here is the agent definition Claude Code loads (frontmatter + system prompt); this file is for you. `README.md` itself is skipped by the install scripts and the linter.*

A subagent runs in its own context window with its own model, tool allowlist and preloaded skills. Claude spawns one with `Agent(subagent_type="<name>", prompt=…)`. [`pair`](../pair/) and [`meta-orchestrator`](../meta-orchestrator/) spawn these, but each also works on its own ("use the planner agent to brief the next issue").

Installed by `scripts/install-skills.*` into `~/.claude/agents/`, with `hooks/` into `~/.claude/agents/hooks/`.

| Agent | Model | Preloads | Spawned by |
|---|---|---|---|

| [`implementer`](#implementer) | sonnet | `handoff-auto`, `session-handoff` | `manager`; `meta-orchestrator` (`execution: flat`) |

## planner

- **Role:** picks the next single unit of work from the board and writes the kickoff brief. Read-only: `disallowedTools: Edit, Write, NotebookEdit`; never creates issues. `maxTurns: 40`.
- **You pass:** repo path + scope contract (exclusions such as gated issues / people tasks / labels, ordering rule).
- **How it works:** runs `next` → drops excluded items → picks exactly one task → uses `divide` to *propose* a split if it looks multi-session → if nothing is left, says so and stops.
- **You get back (≤40 lines):** issue + acceptance checklist, key files, decisions/ADRs to respect, branch name `<prefix>/issue-<n>-<slug>`, gotchas, recommended model (and why), divide yes/no + proposed split.

## manager

- **Role:** owns one task end to end in a worktree. Never implements itself: briefs an implementer, then reviews its work as if it didn't trust it. `maxTurns: 150`.
- **You pass:** working directory (absolute, usually a worktree on the task branch), task + acceptance checklist, rules (branch prefix, protected branch, commit style, `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`AGENTS.md` path), `max_rounds` (default 3).
- **How it works:**
  1. Orients read-only; confirms every file the task cites exists; detects the test command.
  2. Writes a ≤40-line brief (includes "if stuck, write `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md`, commit, stop").
  3. Spawns an `implementer` (not `fork`, no `isolation`) in the foreground by default, blocking until it finishes; if it ends up backgrounded, never sleep-polls — ends the turn titled **INTERIM — implementer still running** and relies on the completion notification (callers must not act on it).
  4. Reviews every round itself, inline: commit scope, `git diff <base>...HEAD`, reruns tests + lint. Fixes one-liners; larger gaps go to the next round. Never spawns reviewer subagents.
  5. Retries with a **fresh** implementer + `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md`/findings, up to `max_rounds`.
- **You get back:** branch + base/head SHA, commits, tests (command + counts) and lint run by it, review findings and who fixed each, rounds used, `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` path if unfinished, manual steps (e.g. the push).
- **Guard:** same `guard-git.py` hook as the implementer. Never pushes, merges or opens PRs — the caller does. Never deletes links or worktrees either, and never a recursive delete through a linked `node_modules`/`.venv` — teardown is the caller's job.

## implementer

- **Role:** implements one well-specified issue from a kickoff brief on its own branch. `maxTurns: 200`.
- **You pass:** the kickoff brief verbatim + branch prefix + protected branch (from `manager` or the orchestrator).
- **How it works:** branches `<prefix>/issue-<n>-<slug>` off a freshly pulled default; if it created the branch, marks the issue started (card → In Progress, or `status:todo` → `status:in-progress`, creating that label first if missing; skipped with no board) and comments "Started on branch …", fail-soft (an error goes in the handoff, never blocks); commits small; runs the repo's detected test command before claiming done. Multi-session task or low turns → writes the handoff early. Stuck or past ~100k tokens → writes `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` (done / not done / next step / failed attempts), commits it, stops, so a manager can restart a fresh implementer from it.
- **You get back:** calls `session-handoff` (which wraps `handoff-auto`); final message ends with the handoff document's absolute path on its own line.
- **Guard:** `guard-git.py` hook (below).

## verifier

- **Role:** verifies an implementation session and closes the loop. `maxTurns: 120`. No guard hook.
- **You pass:** handoff path (or saved manager report path), whether it may answer interview-style questions on your behalf, `review-done=yes|no` (default no; `yes` = a manager already reviewed and reran tests).
- **How it works:**
  1. Runs `update-progress` end to end: claims vs `git log`, tests, CI, code review (skipped if `review-done=yes`), docs/board/issue updates. Code review is inline, two axes (standards + spec), no reviewer subagents.
  2. Deviations: if authorized, answers `consult-plan` itself from the written plan and lists every Q → A; if not, records the deviation and leaves the plan untouched.
  3. Calls `next`.
- **You get back:** verified-by (tests + CI run id), findings fixed / issues filed, decided-for-you list, manual steps for you, then `next`'s output unedited.

## hooks/guard-git.py

`PreToolUse` hook on `Bash|PowerShell`, wired in the `implementer` and `manager` frontmatter. Exits 2 (blocks, reason on stderr) or 0 (allows).

**It is a guardrail, not a sandbox.** It stops an agent's honest mistakes and the obvious workarounds; it can't see inside script files, pre-existing shell aliases/functions, or `curl` to the GitHub API. Pair it with GitHub branch protection (require PRs, no force-push) on the default branch.

**Parsing.** Stdlib Python 3.8+. Splits the command on newlines, `;`, `&&`, `||`, `&`, `|` and `( )`, respecting quotes and dropping `# comments`; tokenizes each piece with `shlex` (POSIX). It recurses into `bash`/`sh`/`zsh -c`, `pwsh`/`powershell -Command` and `-EncodedCommand`, `cmd /c`, `eval`, `$(...)` and backticks, and `echo … | sh` / `bash <<EOF` (a shell reading stdin), `find -exec/-execdir/-ok … ;` and `watch …`. Here-doc bodies fed to anything else are data, so a commit message that says "push to main" is fine. Bash brace expansion is applied to every word (`ma{i,}n` → `main man`, `{a..c}`; quoted braces too, conservatively; over 64 results → unreadable). Before the git subcommand it skips `VAR=x`, `env` (incl. `-S`), `command`, `sudo`, `timeout`, `time -p`, `setsid`, `nohup`, `chronic`, `xargs`, full paths and `git.exe`, and git global options (`-C dir`, `-c k=v`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`, `--no-pager`, …). It resolves git aliases (`-c alias.p=push`, `git config alias.*`).

**Blocked:**

- `git push` with `--force*` (incl. `--force-with-lease=…`, `--force-if-includes`), a short-flag group containing `f` or `d` (`-f`, `-uf`, `-d`), `--mirror`, `--delete`, `--all`/`--branches`, `--prune`
- a refspec starting with `+` (force, any branch), a `:branch` delete refspec, a wildcard refspec, or one whose destination is protected: `main`, `HEAD:main`, `x:refs/heads/main`, `refs/heads/main`, DWIM `HEAD:heads/main`, `refs/heads//main` (case-insensitive); a destination of `@{-1}`-style or `-`
- `git send-pack` / `git http-push` with `--force`, `--all`, `--mirror`, `--stdin`, no refs (= matching branches), or any refspec the push rules above block
- a push with no refspec (`git push`, `git push origin`) or `HEAD`/`$(git branch --show-current)` as refspec while the current branch is protected (`cd dir` and `git -C dir` are followed)
- a refspec it can't read (`$BRANCH`, `$(…)`, `xargs`- or `find {}`-supplied): spell the branch name out
- `gh pr merge`, `gh repo delete`; `gh api` on `pulls/N/merge` or `merges` (any method), writes (`-X`/`--method` non-GET, or `-f`/`-F` fields) to `git/refs/heads/<protected>` or `branches/<protected>/protection`, `DELETE repos/o/r`, and graphql `mergePullRequest`/ref/repo-delete mutations
- `git branch -D/-d/--delete <protected>`
- an unparseable command (unbalanced quotes) that mentions `push` alongside a protected name or a force/delete marker, and any internal error while analysing a command that mentions push/merge/delete (fail closed)

**Allowed (no false positives):** `git push origin krish/x`, `git push -u origin HEAD` on a feature branch, `git commit -m "fix main push"`, `git log main..HEAD`, `gh pr view 5`, `gh api repos/o/r/pulls/5`. `echo git push origin main` is allowed on purpose: the words are arguments to `echo`, nothing runs them (piped into `sh`, it's blocked).

**Interpreter fallback.** The frontmatter `command:` is POSIX `sh` (Claude Code runs hook commands with `sh -c` on macOS/Linux and Git Bash on Windows). It probes `python3`, `python`, `py` for 3.8+ (stdin from `/dev/null`, so the hook JSON stays unread) and `exec`s the first that passes; if none does, it prints the reason and exits 2. A naive `python3 x || python x` would be wrong: a real block (exit 2) from the first would fall through to the second, which reads empty stdin and allows. The Windows Store `python3` stub fails the probe and is skipped. A missing hook file also exits 2 (Python's "can't open file"). Tested with Git Bash (`sh`, `bash`, `dash`), `docker run python:3.12-slim` and `python:3.8-slim` (dash; push to main → 2, feature push → 0) and `debian:bookworm-slim` (no Python → 2). One gap: on Windows without Git Bash, Claude Code falls back to PowerShell, which can't parse the `sh` command, and a non-2 exit doesn't block.

Protected branches: `GUARD_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` (comma list), default `main,master`. A block is working as intended, not something for the agent to route around. Self-test (every case above, current branch injected, plus stdin end-to-end runs): `python agents/hooks/guard-git.py --self-test`.

## Example

```
Agent(subagent_type="planner", prompt="~/code/myrepo; exclusions: label needs-design; order: priority label")
```

→ a brief for #31 (branch `feat/issue-31-csv-export`, recommended model sonnet, divide: no). Pass it verbatim to a `manager`, which returns commits + `pytest 118/118` + "rounds used 1/3"; you push, merge, then hand the saved report to a `verifier` with `review-done=yes`.
