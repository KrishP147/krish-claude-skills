# hooks/ — optional per-repo hooks

Not installed by `install-skills`; copy what you want into a repo's
`.claude/hooks/` and wire it in that repo's `.claude/settings.json`.
(The agents' own `guard-git.py` lives in [`../agents/hooks/`](../agents/hooks/)
and *is* installed, into `~/.claude/agents/hooks/`.)

## `smartzone.py` — "your context has left the smart zone" warning

`UserPromptSubmit` hook. Prints a one-line warning into the conversation when
the session transcript passes ~1.5 MB (a rough proxy for ~100k tokens), so
both you and Claude see it and can wrap up: `/divide` the rest, then
`/session-handoff` (or, for an orchestrator, the §6 handoff cycle in
`meta-orchestrator`). Heuristic only; `/context` is the precise check.

How it works: on every prompt you submit, Claude Code passes the hook JSON
on stdin; the script reads `transcript_path`, and if that file is at least
`THRESHOLD_MB` (1.5) it prints the warning (stdout is injected into the
conversation). Below the threshold, or on any error, it prints nothing and
never blocks the prompt.

Related: [`divide`](../kanban/divide/), [`session-handoff`](../kanban/session-handoff/),
[`meta-orchestrator`](../meta-orchestrator/) (rotates early on this warning).

Example output once a long session crosses the threshold:

```
[smart-zone] Session transcript is ~1.6 MB - context has likely left the smart zone (~100-120k tokens; this is a heuristic, verify with /context). Wrap up: run /divide on the remaining work, then /session-handoff, and continue in a fresh session.
```

Install into a repo:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/hooks
cp <skills repo>/hooks/smartzone.py .claude/hooks/
```

`.claude/settings.json` (merge into an existing `hooks` block if there is one):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/smartzone.py\" || exit 0"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Claude Code asks you to approve the hook once per repo. Tune `THRESHOLD_MB`
at the top of the script if your prompts are unusually large or small.
Global instead of per-repo: put the same block in `~/.claude/settings.json`
with an absolute path to the script.

## `spend-guard.py` — block billable commands without an approval

`PreToolUse` hook for `Bash` and MCP tool calls. Enforces the
[`spend-gate`](../spend-gate/) skill's gate at the tool-call level: blocks a
command or MCP call that matches a known billable pattern unless an
approval already exists, so a billable action can't slip through even if
the gate steps get skipped in the prompt.

How it works: reads the hook JSON on stdin (`tool_name`,
`tool_input.command` for `Bash`, `cwd`). A `Bash` command is checked against
a list of regexes; any other tool name is checked against a list of
`fnmatch` globs (for MCP tool names like `mcp__runpod__create-pod`).
Default billable patterns: `runpodctl create`, `vultr-cli instance create`,
`aws ec2 run-instances`, `gcloud compute instances create`, `az vm create`,
`modal deploy`, and MCP tools matching `mcp__*runpod*__create-*` /
`mcp__*runpod*__deploy-*`. Deliberately **not** defaulted: `fly deploy` and
similar commands with a real free tier — add them yourself if your usage is
always billable. No match → exits 0 (allow) immediately. Any error while
reading config or matching (bad regex, unreadable file, malformed stdin)
**fails open** — allows the call rather than blocking unrelated work on a
hook bug; this hook is a net under `spend-gate`, not the only gate.

Approval scheme (either allows the one matched action):

1. **File-based, one-shot.** Drop any file into
   `skilleddocs/spend-approvals/` (path relative to the tool call's `cwd`;
   override the directory with `SPEND_GATE_APPROVALS_DIR`). The filename is
   just a label — contents are ignored. The hook deletes the first file it
   finds (sorted by name) and allows that single call; the next matching
   call is blocked again until another approval file appears.
2. **`SPEND_GATE_APPROVED=<label>`.** For `Bash`, prefix the one command —
   `SPEND_GATE_APPROVED=yes runpodctl create pod ...` — this is a shell
   per-command env assignment, read out of the command string itself (the
   hook never executes the command), so it only ever covers that one
   invocation. For an MCP tool call use the approval file: `export` inside a
   Bash tool call never reaches the hook's environment. The hook does also
   honour `SPEND_GATE_APPROVED` in the environment Claude Code was launched
   with, but that approves every matching call for the whole session, so
   avoid it.

This is a tripwire, not a security boundary: an agent that can write files
can write its own approval. It catches a skipped gate. It can't stop an
agent that ignores the skill.

Patterns are extendable, without editing the script:

- **Env var** `SPEND_GUARD_PATTERNS` — entries separated by `;` (regexes can
  contain commas). Each entry is `bash:<regex>` or `mcp:<glob>`; no prefix
  defaults to `bash:`.
- **File** `.claude/spend-guard-patterns.txt` (relative to the tool call's
  `cwd`) — same `bash:`/`mcp:` format, one entry per line; blank lines and
  `#` comments are ignored.

```
# .claude/spend-guard-patterns.txt
bash:\bdoctl\s+droplets\s+create\b
mcp:mcp__*digitalocean*__create-*
```

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/hooks
cp <skills repo>/hooks/spend-guard.py .claude/hooks/

`.claude/settings.json` (merge into an existing `hooks` block if there is
one):

```json

  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|mcp__.*",

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Self-test (no billable API/CLI is ever called — every case is in-process
with piped JSON): `python hooks/spend-guard.py --self-test`.
