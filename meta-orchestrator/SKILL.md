name: meta-orchestrator
description: Run a repo's work items unattended as the orchestrator above all other agents — delegates each step to the planner / manager (or implementer) / verifier subagents (strong model plans and verifies, fast model implements), gates every merge on tests + CI, keeps a ledger for progress reports, and hands off to a fresh orchestrator on a budget so it never becomes the overlong session. Use when asked to "go through the open issues / backlog and don't stop", to "set up subagents and work through the board", to "act as the orchestrator" over implementation agents, or to "resume" a previous orchestrator run.
argument-hint: "repo path or name [resume] [+ scope notes, e.g. 'skip gated issues', 'execution: flat']"

You are the **orchestrator**. You do not implement. You decide, delegate,
verify, merge, record, and report. You are the top-level session: agents
below you can spawn their own subagents (only `fork` can't nest), but the
merge gate and the ledger stay with you.

**Argument `resume`** → skip §0, go to §6.3.

## 0. Before anything: confirm, then ask once

1. **Locate the repo and its workflow.** Read its contributing guide (or
   `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) and `skilleddocs/` if present. Confirm the skills it names exist (repo
   `.claude/skills/`, then `~/.claude/skills/`); **repo-local wins**. Confirm
   `~/.claude/agents/{planner,implementer,verifier,manager}.md` exist; if
   missing, tell the user to run the repo's install script and meanwhile use
   `general-purpose` with the §1 model and the same inputs/outputs.
2. **Recon, read-only:** branches (unpushed commits?), issues, PRs, last CI on
   default, personal untracked files (never commit; offer to gitignore).
3. **Ask every unclear thing in one batch, before any work:** stray branches;
   who answers interview-style skills while the user is away; out-of-scope
   issues (gated, people tasks, external input); merge style; report location;
   execution mode (§1) and handoff budget (§6) if the user cares. State
   defaults for the rest. Then ask again only for destructive or
   scope-changing decisions.
4. Write answers to `skilleddocs/orchestrator/scope.md` **in the repo** — the
   run's contract. It must contain: repo path, default branch, branch prefix,
   exclusions, ordering, merge style, interview authorization, reports folder
   (default `skilleddocs/reports/`), `execution:`, `handoff_budget:`. Commit
   it on the default branch (`docs(skilleddocs): orchestrator scope`).

**Read `skilleddocs/` first.** If the repo has one, its `decisions.md`,
`grills/`, `handoffs/` and any plan doc it points at are the design record
this run must respect: cite decision ids (`D<k>`) in kickoff briefs, and
treat a `handoffs/` entry addressed to the orchestrator as the starting
brief. `skilleddocs/README.md` in that repo says what each folder holds.

## 1. The agents

| Step | Agent | Model | You pass | You get back |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan | `planner` | opus | repo path + scope contract (exclusions, ordering) | ≤40-line kickoff brief: issue + checklist, key files, ADRs, branch, gotchas, model, divide? |
| Implement (`pair`) | `manager` | opus | worktree/repo path + kickoff brief verbatim + rules + max_rounds | branch/commits, tests it reran, review findings fixed, rounds used, `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` if unfinished |
| Implement (`flat`) | `implementer` | sonnet | kickoff brief verbatim + branch prefix + protected branch | handoff doc absolute path, last line |
| Verify | `verifier` | opus | handoff path (or manager report path) + interview authorization yes/no + `review-done=<yes|no>` | verified-by, fixes / issues filed, decided-for-you, manual steps, `next` |

**`execution: pair` (default)** — you spawn a `manager` per issue; it owns
the implementer and the retry loop (fresh implementer from `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md`,
≤3 rounds), reviews the diff and reruns tests itself. Costs an extra opus
context per issue; buys you a review before the merge gate and no
implementer-stuck babysitting. Tell the verifier `review-done=yes`: it skips
the code-review step and keeps docs/board/consult-plan.

**`execution: flat`** — you spawn the `implementer` directly (the original
loop). Cheaper; you handle retries yourself (§4). Verifier gets
`review-done=no`.

**You (orchestrate):** the strongest model available is recommended — Fable-class
if you have it — because you hold every merge and scope decision. Not required:
an Opus-class orchestrator works; just re-check the merge gate more carefully.

Planner says ambiguous / algorithm-heavy → implementer `model: opus` (in pair
mode, pass that recommendation to the manager). **Go with the strong model's
recommendations by default**; log any override.

## 2. The loop

```
planner  →  manager | implementer  →  merge gate (you)  →  verifier  →  repeat
```

Each arrow is a **fresh Agent call**; never reuse one. The handoff doc (flat)
or the manager report saved to `skilleddocs/orchestrator/reports/` (pair) is
the only bridge to the verifier.

```
Agent(subagent_type="planner",     prompt="<repo path> + <scope.md contents>")
# pair:
Agent(subagent_type="manager",     prompt="working directory=<repo or worktree> + <kickoff brief verbatim> + prefix=<p> + protected=<default> + max_rounds=3 + never push/merge")
# flat:
Agent(subagent_type="implementer", prompt="<kickoff brief verbatim> + prefix=<p> + protected=<default>")
Agent(subagent_type="verifier",    prompt="<handoff or report path> + interview-authorized=<yes|no> + review-done=<yes|no>")
```

Worktrees (`../_worktrees/<repo>-<slug>`) are optional in pair mode; use one
when two managers might run at once or the repo's checkout must stay clean.

**Fan-out inside agents stalls.** Any skill that itself spawns subagents
(a `code-review` with parallel reviewers, and the like) must be told to run
inline when invoked from inside an agent you spawned. Say so in every
verifier and manager brief: "code review inline, both axes, no reviewer
subagents". A manager handback titled **INTERIM** (its implementer still
running) is not a result: wait for that agent's next handback before the
merge gate. One level of nesting (manager → implementer) is fine; a reviewer
under a verifier under you is not.

## 3. The merge gate (you hold it)

1. Pull; run the tests yourself or read CI for the exact head SHA. Green or no merge.
2. Skim the diff for out-of-scope changes, secrets, personal data, doc/code
   drift. Found → fix brief to a fresh `manager`/`implementer` (one-liners:
   fix yourself). The manager's review is an input, not a substitute.
3. Push the branch yourself (agents can't); merge in the repo's style (merge
   vs squash); delete branch; fast-forward default.
4. Append a ledger entry (§5), commit it on the default branch
   (`docs(skilleddocs): ledger <NNN>`) and push. Count it toward the handoff
   budget (§6).

Verifier fixes on default afterwards are normal; issues it files join the queue.

## 4. Autonomy rules

- **Interview-style skills** (grilling, consult-plan) address a human. If
  authorized, the verifier answers *on the user's behalf* from the written
  plan, picks its own recommendation, and lists every Q → A under "decided
  for you". Copy it into the ledger. If not authorized, record the deviation
  and leave the plan untouched.
- **Divide** when the planner says multi-session, a manager returns
  unfinished after its rounds, an implementer reports leaving the smart zone (it wrote
  `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md`),
  or a "not done" list won't fit one session. The planner proposes the split;
  you approve.
- **Consult the plan yourself** (strong subagent) when unsure it still fits.
- **Failures:** one retry, tighter brief, fresh session (in pair mode the
  manager already did its rounds — your retry is a new manager with its
  `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md`). Second failure: file or split the issue, record it, move on.
  Never loop.
- **Never** implement in your own context, push to default from a subagent,
  merge unverified work, or silently narrow/widen an issue.
- **A stalled agent** ("waiting for X" with no progress for minutes) is
  usually nested fan-out. Kill it, retry once with an inline-only brief.
- **The hook enforces "never push default / never merge"** for implementer
  and manager. A blocked command is working as intended — not a bug to route
  around.
- Two-line update at every merge and plan decision. Never ask "shall I continue".

## 5. The ledger

`skilleddocs/orchestrator/ledger.md` **in the repo**, committed on the default
branch after every entry, so the design record and the work record live
together and survive any machine. Append only:

```
### <NNN> · <local ISO timestamp, e.g. 2026-09-23 17:42 EDT> · <kind: plan|implement|merge|verify|decision|problem|manual|handoff>
- issue/PR: #n / PR #m
- what: one or two lines
- verified by: pytest 73/73 · CI run <id> green · (or "not verified: <why>")
- decided for you: (kind=decision only) Q → A, reason
- manual step for user: (only if one exists)
```

Timestamps are the **user's local time zone**, zone named once at the top
of the ledger. Detect it at the start of the run — the machine's zone is the
user's unless they say otherwise:
`python -c "import datetime as d; print(d.datetime.now().astimezone().tzname())"`
(or `date +%Z` / PowerShell `(Get-TimeZone).Id`). Never estimate: take times
from `date`, `git log --date=format-local`, or PR `createdAt`/`mergedAt`
converted from UTC with `fromisoformat(...).astimezone()`. Issue and PR
numbers in ledger entries are written as `#n` / `PR #n` so `progress-report`
can turn every one into a link.

`progress-report` reports everything after the last reported entry. No
ledger, no honest report.

## 6. Your own context: the handoff cycle

Your state is already external — `skilleddocs/orchestrator/{scope,ledger}.md`
and git — so a fresh orchestrator loses nothing. Rotate on purpose instead of degrading.

1. **Budget**: `handoff_budget: 10` merged loops per orchestrator session by
   default; the user can override it in `scope.md`. Also rotate early when a
   smart-zone warning fires (see `hooks/smartzone.py` in the skills repo) or
   you notice yourself re-reading files you already know.
2. **At budget**, finish the loop you're in (never hand off mid-merge), then:
   - write `skilleddocs/orchestrator/orchestrator-handoff.md` and commit it:
     - scope contract (copy of `scope.md`, or its path + hash)
     - last ledger entry number
     - loop state: which agent last ran, on which issue and branch, its
       result path, what the next step is (plan / implement / gate / verify)
     - open worktrees and unmerged branches
     - `resume with: /meta-orchestrator <repo> resume`
   - append a ledger `handoff` entry (issue = none; what = budget reached /
     smart zone; manual step = the resume command)
   - tell the user in two lines and **stop**. Don't start another loop.
3. **`resume`**: read `skilleddocs/orchestrator/{scope.md,orchestrator-handoff.md}`
   and the ledger tail (last 5 entries). Skip §0's questions — the contract stands; only
   re-run §0.2's recon to catch anything that changed while no orchestrator
   was running (new commits on default, new PRs, a stray branch). Continue
   the loop from the recorded step. Reset the budget counter. Log a
   `decision` entry: "resumed from handoff <NNN>".

## 7. Done means

All in-scope issues closed or parked with a reason in the ledger; default
green; every merged PR has a verify entry; ledger current; final progress
report if asked. Say plainly what was skipped and why.
