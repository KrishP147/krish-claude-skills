# teammate-brief

*`SKILL.md` is the prompt Claude follows; this file is for you.*

## What it does

Writes a handoff document for a person joining or picking up a project: what
it is, setup steps verified by actually running them, which env vars/keys
they need and where to get them (names only, never values), numbered tasks
with a "done when" each, who owns what, and what not to touch.

## When to use

- "Brief my teammate", "write an onboarding doc for X".
- "Hand this project to someone", "what does the new person need to know".
- Not for an agent resuming work — that's [`handoff`](../handoff/README.md).
  Not a public README — that's [`repo-showcase`](../repo-showcase/README.md).
  Not a live status check — that's [`sitrep`](../sitrep/README.md).

## How to invoke

```
/teammate-brief [teammate name or role]
```

Model-invocable, so the trigger phrases above work without the slash.

## How it works

1. **Ask up front, one batch** — audience, role, stack experience, each with
   a recommended default; proceeds on the answers or the defaults.
2. **What it is, then setup** — opens with what the project is and its state; gathers steps from README/package
   files/Makefile/etc., runs each one in the current environment, and marks
   any step it didn't run as "unverified" with the reason (destructive,
   needs credentials, too slow).
3. **Env vars and keys table** — variable name, what it's for, where to get
   it (dashboard, teammate, secrets manager); names only, never values,
   never read from an actual `.env`/secrets file.
4. **Numbered tasks** — each with a concrete "done when", pulled from open
   issues where the repo has them.
5. **Ownership map** — area/path -> who to ask.
6. **Don't-touch list** — what to leave alone and why, per item.
7. **Draft, then write** — shows the full draft before writing; saves to
   `skilleddocs/briefs/<name>-<local-date>.md` on confirmation.
8. **GATE** — commits only on yes, pushes only on a separate yes, never
   shares or sends the document anywhere.

## Design principles

- **Verified, not copied.** Setup steps are run, not transcribed from a
  stale README — anything not actually run is labeled unverified with why.
- **Names, never values.** The env/keys table tells a teammate what to get
  and where, and never touches an actual secret.
- **For a person, not an agent.** Plain language, no skill/tool/session
  jargon — this document is read once, by someone who isn't running Claude.

## Use cases

- Onboarding a new contributor to a project they didn't build.
- Handing your own project to a teammate before time off or a role change.
- Splitting ownership of a repo across people and writing down who owns what.

## Tips

- No strong opinions on the §1 questions? Say "go" — the defaults assume a
  newcomer, which means more detail, not less.
- If a setup step needs credentials you don't have, say so — an "unverified"
  step with a clear reason is more useful than a guess presented as fact.
- Re-run this after a project's setup changes; a brief written against an
  old `Makefile` is worse than no brief.

## Example

```
/teammate-brief new backend dev
```

Asks audience/role/experience, gets "go" (defaults accepted, assumes new to
the stack); runs `npm install` and `npm test` and watches both pass; finds
`PAYMENTS_KEY` and `DB_URL` read from the environment and notes where each
comes from; pulls three open issues into numbered tasks with a "done when"
each; maps `api/` and `infra/` to their owners; lists `migrations/` as
don't-touch with the reason; shows the full draft; writes
`skilleddocs/briefs/new-backend-dev-2026-09-26.md` on yes; commits on a separate yes;
does not push or share it further without being asked.

## Related

- [`handoff`](../handoff/README.md) — the agent/conversation-state
  counterpart; use that when a session, not a person, is picking up the work.
- [`repo-showcase`](../repo-showcase/README.md) — the public-facing
  counterpart; use that for a stranger landing on the repo, not a teammate
  joining the team.
- [`sitrep`](../sitrep/README.md) — a live "right now" status check, not a
  document.
