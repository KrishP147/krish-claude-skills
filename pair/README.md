# pair

*`SKILL.md` is the prompt Claude follows; this file is for you.*

## What it does

Runs **one task** (a GitHub issue or free text) through a `manager` subagent in an isolated git worktree. The manager spawns and reviews an `implementer`, retrying up to 3 rounds. You stay in one interactive session; only your session pushes and opens the PR, at the end.

## When to use

- One task on any repo, including OSS forks with no kanban board.
- "Implement issue #n with a manager + implementer", "pair on this".
- For a whole backlog, use [`meta-orchestrator`](../meta-orchestrator/) instead.

## How to invoke

```
/pair <issue # | task text> [--no-worktree] [--push] [--model opus|sonnet]
```

- `--no-worktree` — new branch in the current checkout instead of a worktree.
- `--push` — push and open the PR without asking.
- `--model` — implementer model override (default: manager's choice, sonnet for mechanical work).

Model-invocable, so "pair on issue 12" also works.

## How it works

1. **Resolve the task.** Issue number → `gh issue view`; text → Claude writes a 3–6 item acceptance checklist. Collects default branch, branch prefix (from your `CLAUDE.md`, else `feat`), test command, `CONTRIBUTING.md`/`AGENTS.md`. On a fork (`upstream` remote): fetches upstream, fast-forwards the default branch, and checks every file/symbol the issue cites still exists.
2. **Isolate.** `git worktree add ../_worktrees/<repo>-<slug> -b <prefix>/<slug> <default>` (slug = `issue-<n>-<kebab-title>`). Reuses an existing worktree/branch if present. Deps (`node_modules`/`.venv`) are linked from the main checkout (`mklink /J` on Windows, `ln -s` elsewhere), not reinstalled. For an issue, your session then marks it started (card → In Progress, or `status:todo` → `status:in-progress`; skipped with no board) and comments "Started on branch …"; a board error is reported, never blocking.
3. **Delegate.** One `Agent(subagent_type="manager")` call with working dir, task + checklist, verified/missing files, rules, implementer model, `max_rounds: 3`, "never push, merge, or open a PR". Not `fork`.
4. **On return.** Ignores a report titled **INTERIM** (implementer still running) and waits for the manager's next handback. Then shows the manager's report verbatim; reruns tests if the report is thin or risky; if `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` exists (unfinished), offers another round. Pushes + `gh pr create … Closes #<n>` on `--push` or your go. Never merges. PR review feedback later → step 3 again in the same worktree.
5. **Print.** Branch, worktree path, PR URL (or "not pushed"), test result, rounds used, `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` path. Doesn't clean up the worktree until the PR merges — and then links-first (never a recursive delete through a linked `node_modules`/`.venv`), before `git worktree remove`.

Writes: a worktree + branch; commits (via agents); `skilleddocs/HANDOFF.md` in the worktree if unfinished.

## Related

- Spawns the [`manager`](../agents/README.md#manager) agent, which spawns [`implementer`](../agents/README.md#implementer).
- [`meta-orchestrator`](../meta-orchestrator/) runs the same manager per issue in `execution: pair` mode.
- Needs `gh` and the agents installed.

## Example

```
/pair 42 --push
```

Reads issue #42, creates `../_worktrees/myrepo-issue-42-fix-date-parsing` on `feat/issue-42-fix-date-parsing`, the manager's implementer fixes it in 1 round, the manager reruns tests (`pytest 118/118`), you see the report, then the branch is pushed and a PR opened with `Closes #42`.
