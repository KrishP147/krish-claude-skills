# site

Static site for this repo's skills and agents: a Claude Code style terminal
home with a locked slash input, a plain list of every skill and agent, and a
`/<name>` detail page for each. No framework, no npm install, no runtime deps.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/index.html` | home template (`{{COUNT}}`, `{{LIST}}`, `{{DATA}}` filled at build) |
| `src/detail.html` | `/<name>` detail page template (sticky slash prompt, header card + chips, sections, prev/next, `#comments` placeholder) |
| `data/meta.json` | per-name author + battle-tested level (`levels_source` says where levels come from); names not listed get level `new`, author defaults to Krish |
| `src/404.html`, `src/style.css` | not-found page, all styles |
| `src/filter.js` | pure slash-input logic (browser global `SkillFilter`, CommonJS in node) |
| `src/app.js` | DOM wiring: events, dropdown, navigation (shared by home and detail pages; `data-autofocus="false"` on the input skips autofocus) |
| `test/filter.test.mjs` | node:test suite for `filter.js` |
| `dist/` | build output, git-ignored |

Build script: [`../scripts/build_site.py`](../scripts/build_site.py) (stdlib
only), with [`site_detail.py`](../scripts/site_detail.py) for detail pages and
[`md_render.py`](../scripts/md_render.py), a small Markdown renderer that
escapes all raw HTML and drops non-http(s)/mailto link URLs. It reuses `scripts/lint.py`'s discovery, so the site lists exactly what
lint counts. Groups: top-level skill dirs = core, `kanban/*` = kanban,
`agents/*.md` (minus README) = agents.

## Detail pages

- **Sources.** Skill: its `README.md`. Agent: its `## <name>` section of
  `agents/README.md` (the `- **Label:**` bullets become sections, e.g.
  Role → What it does, You pass → How to invoke) plus `agents/<name>.md`
  frontmatter (model, tools / disallowedTools, preloads, guard hook). Agents
  also get the shared `## Example` and a generated Related list (preloads +
  pages that link to them).
- **Sections**, in order: What it does, When to use, How to invoke, How it
  works, Design principles, Use cases, Tips, Example, Related, Prereqs, then
  any README sections that don't map (original heading kept), then Source.
  Heading matching is tolerant (`Invoke`, `Examples`, `Prerequisite: …` all
  map). Empty or missing sections are not rendered. A skill with no Prereqs
  section inherits its parent group README's (e.g. `kanban/README.md`).
- **Links.** Relative links become
  `https://github.com/KrishP147/skills/blob/master/<path>` (anchors kept);
  links to another skill's dir or README become `/<name>`, and
  `agents/README.md#<agent>` becomes `/<agent>`.
- **Chips:** author (cross-checked in tests against
  `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`), invocation (`user only` when the SKILL.md
  frontmatter has `disable-model-invocation: true`), model / tools / preloads
  (agents), prereqs, tested level.

Never add a file named `SKILL.md` under `site/`: lint globs `*/SKILL.md` and
`*/*/SKILL.md` and would treat it as a skill.

## Build, test, preview

```sh
python scripts/lint.py
python scripts/build_site.py              # wipes + writes site/dist/
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p "test_*.py"
node --test site/test/filter.test.mjs   # list files; Node 22 on Windows rejects a dir arg
python -m http.server -d site/dist 8000   # http://localhost:8000
```

Output: `index.html`, `skills.json` (name, description, summary, group,
source, readme), `<name>/index.html` detail page per skill/agent (so `/pair` resolves
statically), `404.html`, `style.css`, `filter.js`, `app.js`. The build is
deterministic.

## Deploy (Vercel free tier) — manual steps

Config lives in the repo-root [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json)
(`buildCommand: python3 scripts/build_site.py`, `outputDirectory: site/dist`,
`cleanUrls`). It is at the root because the build needs files outside `site/`.

1. vercel.com → Add New → Project → import `KrishP147/skills`.
2. Leave **Root Directory** as the repo root (`./`). Framework preset: Other.
   Build/output settings come from `vercel.json`; don't override them.
3. Deploy. Check `/`, `/pair`, and a bad path (404 page).
4. Domain: Project → Settings → Domains → add `skills.krishpunjabi.com`.
   At the DNS provider for `krishpunjabi.com` add a `CNAME` record
   `skills` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` (use whatever target Vercel shows).
   Wait for Vercel to mark it valid (HTTPS is automatic).

Fallback, if Root Directory must be `site/`: move the config to
`site/vercel.json` with `"buildCommand": "python3 ../scripts/build_site.py"`
and `"outputDirectory": "dist"`, and keep "Include source files outside of
the Root Directory" enabled (Vercel's default) so `scripts/` and the skill
dirs are available at build time.
